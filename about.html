      <div>
        <p> Growing up, my first passion was art. I loved to collect
          sketchbooks and fill them up with my cartoon drawings.
          Through grade school I was always enrolled in an art
          class, and that followed me to college as well. I didn't
          major in Art, however after I graduated college and after
          spending some time as an educator, I reconnected with art
          by way of UI design. I took a bootcamp course through
          careerfoundry and learned all about UI design. As a hobby
          I teach myself how to create digital art using Procreate.
          Aside from Art and design, I love being in and around the
          water and I enjoy spending time in coffee shops. </p>
